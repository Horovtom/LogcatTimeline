# Function runtime visualiser for logcat

This program allows the user to specify a logcat output log file. It will find pairs of log entries that match and place them on a timeline, which is displayed by the program. This program supports recursive calls.

## Usage
1. After launching the sketch, it will ask the user for a *filter phrase*. This is a String that is present on all considered log entries. In other words, this script will omit all lines, that do *not* contain this *filter phrase*. 
2. The sketch will ask the user for a log file. This log file should be of format specified in [this section](##logfile-format).

## Logfile format
The logfile should be in a standard format generated by adb logcat tool. TheLine from such logcat could look like this:
`06-21 14:59:19.842 11351 11351 D TrafficLog: onEnabled::start`
The string will be split by ` `. The second field after the split will be parsed as the time. (It should be in the format hh:mm:ss.Milliseconds). The last field after will be split by `::`. The first part will be considered as *function name*, while the second part should be either `start` or `end` respectively.
